How It Works

User enters a city name in the input field

Application sends a request to the weather API

API returns live weather data

JavaScript processes the response

Weather details are displayed on the screen

Setup & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sujitsahu461/weather-project.git


Open the project folder:

cd weather-project


Open index.html in any web browser

Run the application locally with:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5501. Do not use Live Server: it can serve the HTML but cannot provide the app's `/api/*` weather routes.

Enter a city name and view the weather details

Future Enhancements

Auto-detect user location

Weather icons and animations

Error handling for invalid city names
